# NotesWay – Project Overview

## Project Summary
**NotesWay** is a production-ready, cloud-hosted academic notes management platform designed for students, professors, and educational institutions. The application enables secure uploading, organization, sharing, and downloading of academic resources with a strong emphasis on scalability, security, and real-world deployment practices.

The project demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development combined with modern cloud and DevOps workflows using AWS infrastructure.
